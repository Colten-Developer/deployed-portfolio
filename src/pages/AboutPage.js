                    Howdy! Thank you for checking out my site. A little bit about me, I am a software engineer with experience in electrical engineering, customer service, SEO, and management! I focus on the big picture when it comes to tackling projects and I understand the need for things to be done in orderly, precise, and in a timely manner and I love collaborating and working with teams.                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I started to code 5 years ago as a freshman in high school. my first projects were simple games using Game Maker Studio and Udemy. I eventually moved on to become the programming team captain of our state recognized robotics team. We competed in the FIRST robotics competition where teams of high school students are challenged to build industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game in alliance with other teams.                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While studying electrical engineering at Texas A&M, I found that my passions were in line with the computer science courses.  Being able to process data and do advanced mathematics far faster than by hand was astonishing.

                    After COVID-19 hit, I found myself needing to find a way to continue my education online versus going back to class on campus and from there I pursued Thinkfulâ€™s Software Engineering program.                   </p>

                    I understand the need for software to be put together cleanly from both the developer and client standpoint. When developing for the front-end I like to focus on the responsiveness of the application. This allows users seamless access to their applications from any device. I find that handling data is the most important piece when it comes to back-end development. Without proper data management nothing can be accomplished. I am innovative, a self-starter and a team player and excited to continue my career as a Full Stack Developer!                  </p>
